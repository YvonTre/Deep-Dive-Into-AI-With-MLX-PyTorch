# Chapter 8 - Refining the Recipe in the AI Kitchen

![final-plating.png](images%2Ffinal-plating.png)

Welcome back to our AI kitchen, where we continue our culinary journey through the world of artificial intelligence with PyTorch and MLX (hopefullyðŸ¤—). In this chapter, we'll be revisiting the steps we've taken with Tenny, our trusty AI sous-chef, refining our techniques, and stirring in a dash of best practices to perfect our recipe.

In the previous chapters, we meticulously prepared our ingredients â€“ financial data in wide CSV format â€“ and trained Tenny, our AI model, to predict future stock prices. We've seen how Tenny, like a sous-chef, takes these prepared ingredients and processes them to create a delectable dish â€“ in this case, valuable insights from data.

Now, we're going to refine our methods. We'll take a closer look at what to expect when training Tenny and using him for predictions, explore the significance of the features in our dataset, and discuss the importance of correlation. Most crucially, we'll delve into why it's essential to avoid projecting human biases and assumptions onto Tenny's learning process.

By the end of this chapter, you'll have a clearer understanding of the nuances involved in AI model training and prediction, and how to approach these processes with a more refined touch.

## Expectations and Interpretations in AI Predictions

First, I recommend reading the following essays before you continue:

[Weights-Are-All-You-Need-Human-vs-AI.md](..%2F..%2Fessays%2FAI%2FWeights-Are-All-You-Need-Human-vs-AI.md)

Reading these essays will enhance your understanding of the subtleties in training and predicting with AI models. It will guide you on how to engage in these processes more astutely and with less bias. 

In essence, never make assumptions about what AI, or anyone for that matter, including yourself, can or cannot do. If we start assuming, there's no point in having them around. The crux of the matter is to remain open to fresh opportunities and novel thought processes. It's the sole path to growth and enhancement.

### Understanding Tenny's Predictive Abilities

![galaxy-of-neurons.png](images%2Fgalaxy-of-neurons.png)

When training Tenny, setting realistic expectations is key. Tenny, like any AI model, learns from the data it's given. However, its predictions aren't fail-safe. They're based on patterns and trends in the data. By feeding Tenny historical financial data, he learns to comprehend and forecast stock prices, but these forecasts are probabilistic and should be viewed as such.

I can't emphasize enough how your biased assumptions can impact Tenny's learning process. Believing Tenny can foresee the future sets you up for disappointment. Tenny isn't a soothsayer; he's a machine learning model that learns from data. His predictions are only as good as the data he receives. Garbage in, garbage out; quality data in, quality predictions out. It's as straightforward as that.

Moreover, prejudging what Tenny might learn during training skews the inputs with your biases. This leads to a self-fulfilling prophecy: you'll end up with what you expect. Experiment with diverse data and assumptions. You'll be surprised by the outcomes. Even when the possibilities seem slim, they exist. That's the beauty of AI â€“ it isn't constrained by our assumptions, only by our imagination.

Look at the first example we went over in the prologue, 'Hello AI World':

```python
...
x_train = [40, 1, 16, 95, 79, 96, 9, 35, 37, 63, 45, 98, 75, 48, 25, 90, 27, 71, 35, 32]
y_train = [403, 13, 163, 953, 793, 963, 93, 353, 373, 633, 453, 983, 753, 483, 253, 903, 273, 713, 353, 323]
```
Tenny isn't aware of the equation `y = 10x + 3`, as it's a concept created by humans. Tenny's knowledge is limited to the data you provide. While you might assume Tenny could deduce the equation by analyzing data pairs, that's not how it operates. Tenny doesn't understand what an equation is. His capability lies in discerning relationships between data pairs, which explains the subtle variations in his predictions.

You might believe you understand how AI operates because the architecture appears simple. However, consider something like GPT-4, which has up to 2 trillion parameters, including weights and biases. With such complexity, it becomes a significant challenge to fully grasp what it does or what it learns. 

Imagine a pretrained model like GPT-4 as a vast, intricate galaxy, where each of its 2 trillion parameters represents a star. Each star's position and brightness are carefully calibrated to illuminate the path to the best responses for any given input. Just as one cannot grasp the full expanse of a galaxy at a glance, the workings of this AI model elude complete understanding. Yet, in this vastness lies its elegance and power. It's a humbling reminder of the limits of our knowledge and the endless possibilities of AI. So, resist the urge to assume complete understanding; the universe of AI is far more expansive than what meets the eye.

Never presume that Tenny will learn exactly as you expect. Allow him to learn independently. You might find the outcomes surprising. If you skew your data with your own biases, Tenny will simply mirror you, which defeats the purpose of AI. The essence of AI is to offer a distinct perspective, a novel way of thinking, and to reveal insights you might not have seen.

Remember, even great minds like Isaac Newton and Albert Einstein were proven wrong in some areas. The history of human error is a continuous loop. Don't heed those who say something is impossible. The 'impossible' has been disproved time and again. So, experiment with your ideas. That's the essence of science, AI, and life itself.

Who knows? You might be the next luminary in AI. ðŸ˜Š

### Feature Relationships and Their Significance

![excel-data.png](images%2Fexcel-data.png)

In our dataset, each feature â€“ such as Normalized Price, P/E Ratio, Net EPS, and others â€“ plays a unique role. Understanding these features and their relationships is akin to understanding the ingredients in a recipe and how they interact to create a dish. Some features might have a direct impact on the stock price (like the main ingredients in a dish), while others might play a more subtle, complementary role.

### The Role of Correlation

Correlation in data is like the flavor profile in cooking. Just as certain flavors complement each other, some data features have strong correlations, indicating a relationship. However, a high correlation doesn't always mean causation. In the AI kitchen, it's crucial to recognize which correlations are meaningful and which might lead to misleading conclusions.

Refer back to the earlier chapters to see how we calculated the correlation between features and interpreted the results. We used the Pearson correlation coefficient, which measures the linear correlation between two variables. The coefficient ranges from -1 to 1, with 0 indicating no correlation, 1 indicating a perfect positive correlation, and -1 indicating a perfect negative correlation.

### Avoiding Human Bias in AI Learning

Again, one of the most important aspects to remember is not to impose human assumptions on Tennyâ€™s learning process. Just as a chef must be open to new flavors and combinations, we must allow Tenny to identify patterns and relationships in the data independently. What might seem obvious or irrelevant to us could be significant in Tenny's analysis. Our role is to guide and refine, not dictate Tennyâ€™s learning process.

History has repeatedly illustrated the pitfalls of narrow-minded mentorship and its parallels in AI development. Picture a mentor who, instead of encouraging exploration and independent thought, imposes their own viewpoints and methodologies rigidly on their student. This approach stifles creativity and critical thinking, leading the student to become a mere echo of their mentor, unable to contribute new ideas or perspectives.

Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux, indeed thrived in an environment that fostered free exploration and development of ideas. His differing views with Andrew Tanenbaum, a significant figure in operating system development, are well-documented. This contrast in approaches and philosophies arguably played a role in shaping the unique path Torvalds took with Linux. Such interactions highlight the importance of diverse perspectives in technological innovation and the unpredictable course of creative endeavors.

If Linus Torvalds had conformed his ideas to fit Andrew Tanenbaum's perspectives, it's quite possible that Linux might not have come into existence in the form we know today. This adaptation could have stifled Torvalds' unique approach and perspective, leading to a different trajectory in the world of technology. The open-source philosophy, which is central to Linux and has significantly influenced the technological landscape, might not have gained the same level of prominence. This could have had widespread implications for the development and accessibility of technology on a global scale.

In the realm of artificial intelligence, this scenario is akin to training an AI system with a dataset heavily skewed by the biases and limitations of its creators. The AI, much like the student, would only reflect the perspectives and inclinations of its 'mentor', in this case, the data it was trained on. The result is an AI that perpetuates existing biases, unable to provide novel insights or challenge established norms.

The concept of an 'ancestor class' in programming provides a relevant analogy here. An ancestor class is a base class from which other classes are derived. If the ancestor class is limited in its functionality or contains flawed logic, all derived classes will inherit these limitations or flaws. Similarly, if our foundational approaches to AI training are biased or narrow, all subsequent AI models derived from these approaches will likely exhibit the same issues.

[The-Perils-of-Rushed-Learning.md](..%2F..%2Fessays%2Flife%2FThe-Perils-of-Rushed-Learning.md)

Therefore, the point of having a mentor, or in AI terms, a foundational dataset or training approach, should be to provide a broad, balanced foundation. It should encourage the development of AI systems capable of independent thought and reasoning, capable of challenging existing ideas and contributing novel solutions. This approach not only enriches the student or the AI system but also contributes to the advancement of knowledge and technology in ways that rigid, biased mentorship cannot. 

As we move forward, keep these points in mind. They are the key ingredients to a successful AI model, one that is trained effectively and delivers reliable, insightful predictions. Let's roll up our sleeves and dive into the refined process of training and understanding Tenny in the world of AI and finance.

## Best Practices of the AI Kitchen

![excel-data.png](images%2Fexcel-data.png)

To prepare the given data format for feeding Tenny, our AI model, we need to follow a series of best practices. These steps ensure that the data is in the most optimal form for Tenny to process and learn from. 

Let's recap the steps we took in the previous chapters to prepare our data for Tenny:

### 1. Transposing Data to Long Format

The data is currently in a wide format, which is not ideal for most machine learning models, including Tenny. We need to transpose it to a long format. This means converting our data so that each row represents a single time point for a single variable. In our case, each row will represent a fiscal quarter for one specific feature (like Normalized Price, P/E Ratio, etc.).

**Why Long Format?**
- Easier to handle variable time frames and missing values.
- More compatible with PyTorchâ€™s data handling capabilities.

### 2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

Even though we assume the data is already clean, it's always good to perform a quick check for anomalies or inconsistencies.

- **Check for Missing Values:** Ensure there are no missing values, or handle them appropriately if there are.
- **Data Type Consistency:** Ensure each column is of the correct data type (e.g., numerical columns should not be recognized as strings).
- **Outlier Detection:** Identify and handle any outliers, as they can skew the modelâ€™s learning.

### 3. Feature Engineering

Since we have multiple financial indicators, itâ€™s crucial to understand how each might affect the target variable (Normalized Price). Feature engineering might involve:

- **Creating Ratios:** Sometimes ratios of features can be more informative than the features themselves.
- **Normalization/Standardization:** Especially important in finance data to account for different scales.

### 4. Time Series Considerations

While our data is not time-sensitive in the usual sense of time-series data, it's still sequential. Itâ€™s important to respect this sequence as it can contain valuable information about trends and patterns.

- **No Random Shuffling:** Keep the data in chronological order.
- **Windowing Technique:** If needed, use a windowing technique to create a series of inputs for the model to learn from sequential patterns.

### 5. Train-Test Split

Split the data into training and test sets. This is crucial for evaluating the model's performance.

- **Chronological Split:** Ensure that the split respects the time sequence (i.e., no future data in the training set).

### 6. DataLoader Preparation

Utilize PyTorchâ€™s DataLoader capabilities to efficiently load data during training.

- **Batch Processing:** Set a batch size for the DataLoader to optimize the training process.
- **Custom Dataset Class:** Implement a custom dataset class, like TennyDataset, that interfaces well with PyTorchâ€™s DataLoader.

### 7. Final Check Before Training

- **Sanity Check:** Perform a final check to ensure everything is loaded correctly and the data looks as expected.
- **Dimensionality Check:** Verify that the input data is in the correct shape and format expected by the model.

By following these best practices, we ensure that the data is in a state that is conducive to effective learning by Tenny. This meticulous preparation is similar to a chef ensuring all ingredients are prepped and ready before starting to cook. Itâ€™s an essential step to achieving the best results from our AI kitchen.

## More Ideas for Refining the Recipe

We've implemented a comprehensive and robust approach for preparing and processing data, along with training and evaluating Tenny. To further enhance this process, consider these additional ideas:

### 1. Data Augmentation and Synthetic Data Generation
- **Synthetic Data Generation:** To increase the robustness of Tenny, consider generating synthetic data that mimics real-world scenarios not covered in your dataset. This can be particularly useful for rare but critical financial conditions.
- **Data Augmentation Techniques:** Experiment with data augmentation techniques like adding Gaussian noise, which can help the model generalize better.

### 2. Feature Selection and Dimensionality Reduction
- **Feature Importance Analysis:** Use techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) or feature importance metrics from tree-based models to identify and retain the most significant features.
- **Dimensionality Reduction:** Apply dimensionality reduction techniques to simplify the model without losing critical information. This can also help in speeding up the training process.

### 3. Hyperparameter Tuning and Optimization
- **Automated Hyperparameter Tuning:** Consider using automated hyperparameter tuning tools like learning rate schedulers or Bayesian optimization to find the best hyperparameters for your model.
- **Experiment with Different Architectures:** Try varying the number of layers, different types of layers (like LSTM or GRU for sequence data), or other architectural changes to see if they yield better results.

I've already played around with these concepts in the code. However, I've found that simply going deeper with networks and adding complexity isn't always the answer. It's really about striking that sweet spot between how complex your model is and how well it performs. Tweaking learning rates and using different optimization strategies might be the key, but it's pretty much a trial-and-error game to find what works best. In my own tests, using the scheduler in PyTorch didn't really improve things, but hey, it's definitely something worth exploring.

To incorporate a learning rate scheduler into our existing `train` function, we can use PyTorch's `ReduceLROnPlateau` scheduler. This scheduler will adjust the learning rate based on the validation loss, reducing it when the loss plateaus. Here's how you can integrate it into your training loop:
```python
from torch.optim.lr_scheduler import ReduceLROnPlateau
scheduler = ReduceLROnPlateau(optimizer, mode='min', factor=0.1, patience=5, verbose=True)
```

In this example, the scheduler will reduce the learning rate by a factor of 0.1 if there is no improvement in the `min` metric (like validation loss) for 5 epochs (`patience=5`).

Let's see how we could integrate this into our existing code. 

Before the training loop, initialize the learning rate scheduler. Make sure to do this after initializing the optimizer because the scheduler needs to modify the optimizer's learning rate.

```python
from torch.optim.lr_scheduler import ReduceLROnPlateau

# Initialize the scheduler
scheduler = ReduceLROnPlateau(optimizer, mode='min', factor=0.1, patience=5, verbose=True)
```

Next, within our training loop, we update the scheduler at the end of each epoch, using the validation loss to guide its adjustments.

```python
def train(model, train_dataset, val_dataset, criterion, optimizer):
    # ... [previous code] ...

    # Initialize the scheduler
    scheduler = ReduceLROnPlateau(optimizer, mode='min', factor=0.1, patience=5, verbose=True)

    for epoch in range(NUM_EPOCHS):
        # ... [training and validation phases] ...

        # Step the scheduler
        scheduler.step(val_loss)

        # ... [rest of your training loop] ...
```

Monitor the learning rate changes and the model's performance across epochs. You may need to adjust the `factor`, `patience`, or other parameters of the scheduler based on your observations.

#### Important Considerations:
1. **Factor and Patience Tuning:** The `factor` and `patience` parameters are crucial. `factor` determines how much the learning rate is reduced each time, and `patience` specifies the number of epochs to wait before reducing the learning rate. These need to be tuned according to your model and data.

2. **Verbose Output:** Setting `verbose=True` helps to track when the scheduler reduces the learning rate, providing insight into the training process.

3. **Scheduler Impact Assessment:** Regularly assess the impact of the learning rate scheduler on your model's training and validation performance to determine if it's beneficial.

4. **Compatibility with Early Stopping:** Ensure that the learning rate scheduler works harmoniously with your early stopping logic. The scheduler might find new optima with a lower learning rate after the model initially stops improving, so consider adjusting your early stopping criteria accordingly.

Integrating a learning rate scheduler can help overcome training plateaus and lead to better model performance, but it does require careful monitoring and tuning to find the most effective settings for your specific case.

### 4. Advanced Regularization Techniques
- **Advanced Dropout Techniques:** Experiment with variations of dropout to improve model generalization.
- **Weight Regularization:** Apply L1/L2 regularization on the weights to prevent overfitting.

To implement advanced dropout techniques and weight regularization in the Tenny architecture, we can modify the existing class as follows:

Instead of using a standard dropout, we might consider using variations like Alpha Dropout or Spatial Dropout. These can provide different approaches to regularization and may be more suitable depending on your network architecture and data. Just experiment with different dropout techniques and see what works best for your model.

For example, if you're dealing with a network that uses batch normalization, Alpha Dropout can be a good choice as it maintains the mean and variance of the inputs.

Here's how you can integrate Alpha Dropout into Tenny:

```python
from torch.nn import AlphaDropout

class Tenny(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, output_size):
        super(Tenny, self).__init__()
        # ... [other layers] ...
        self.dropout = AlphaDropout(0.5)  # Replace standard Dropout with AlphaDropout

    def forward(self, x):
        # ... [forward pass] ...
        # Replace dropout call with alpha dropout
        # ...
```

Weight regularization can be applied by adding an additional term to the loss function. In PyTorch, you typically do this in the training loop, not in the model definition. L1 regularization adds a term that is proportional to the absolute value of the weight coefficients, and L2 regularization adds a term proportional to the square of the weight coefficients.

Here's how you can modify the training loop to include L1 or L2 regularization:

```python
def train(model, train_dataset, val_dataset, criterion, optimizer, l1_lambda=0.001, l2_lambda=0.001):
    # ... [setup DataLoader and move model to device] ...

    for epoch in range(NUM_EPOCHS):
        model.train()
        for inputs, labels in train_loader:
            inputs, labels = inputs.to(DEVICE), labels.to(DEVICE)
            outputs = model(inputs)
            loss = criterion(outputs, labels)

            # L1 Regularization
            l1_reg = torch.tensor(0.).to(DEVICE)
            for param in model.parameters():
                l1_reg += torch.norm(param, 1)
            loss += l1_lambda * l1_reg

            # L2 Regularization
            l2_reg = torch.tensor(0.).to(DEVICE)
            for param in model.parameters():
                l2_reg += torch.norm(param, 2)
            loss += l2_lambda * l2_reg

            # ... [rest of the training loop] ...
```

In this modified `train` function, `l1_lambda` and `l2_lambda` are hyperparameters that control the regularization strength. You'll need to experiment with these values to find the right balance for your model and data.

#### Important Notes:

- **Regularization Strength:** The values of `l1_lambda` and `l2_lambda` are crucial. If they are too high, they might harm the model's learning ability. If too low, they may have little effect.
- **Monitoring Performance:** Regularly evaluate how these changes affect your model's performance. Observe both training and validation metrics to ensure the model isn't overfitting or underfitting.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** You may need to retune other hyperparameters after introducing these regularization techniques, as they can significantly change the model's learning dynamics.

By carefully implementing and tuning these techniques, you can enhance Tenny's ability to generalize and reduce the risk of overfitting, potentially leading to improved performance on unseen data.

### 5. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Enhancements
- **Advanced Visualization:** Implement more advanced visualization techniques to better understand complex relationships in the data, potentially using tools like seaborn or Plotly.
- **Correlation Analysis:** Conduct a more detailed correlation analysis to uncover hidden relationships or redundancies among the features.

### 6. Advanced Validation Techniques
- **Cross-Validation:** Use cross-validation to ensure the modelâ€™s performance is consistent across different subsets of the data.
- **Time Series Specific Splits:** For time-series data, ensure that validation splits respect time boundaries to avoid lookahead bias.

### 7. Robustness and Stress Testing
- **Stress Testing:** Conduct stress tests by feeding the model with extreme values or unusual patterns to evaluate its robustness and response to edge cases.
- **Adversarial Testing:** Experiment with adversarial inputs to test the modelâ€™s resilience against such scenarios.

### 8. Real-time Data Integration (if applicable)
- **Real-time Data Feeding:** If applicable, set up a pipeline for Tenny to process real-time data, enabling dynamic predictions based on the latest market conditions. You will need a reliable data source for this, such as an API or a web scraper, preferably API since it's more reliable and secure.

By implementing these additional ideas, you can further refine Tennyâ€™s capabilities, making it more robust, accurate, and efficient in handling complex financial data for prediction tasks.

Let's do a quick review of the key components:

1. **AlphaDropout in Neural Network Architecture**: We have replaced the standard dropout with AlphaDropout in the `Tenny` class. This is particularly useful when you are dealing with models that use activations like SELU (Scaled Exponential Linear Unit), as Alpha Dropout is designed to work with them while maintaining the properties of the inputs.

    ```python
    self.dropout = AlphaDropout(0.5)
    ```

2. **L1 and L2 Regularization in the Training Loop**: We have implemented both L1 and L2 regularization in the `train` function. The regularization terms are added to the loss, which helps in preventing overfitting by penalizing large weights.

    ```python
    l1_reg = torch.tensor(0.).to(DEVICE)
    l2_reg = torch.tensor(0.).to(DEVICE)
    for param in model.parameters():
        l1_reg += torch.norm(param, 1)
        l2_reg += torch.norm(param, 2)
    loss += L1_LAMBDA * l1_reg + L2_LAMBDA * l2_reg
    ```

3. **ReduceLROnPlateau Learning Rate Scheduler**: The `ReduceLROnPlateau` scheduler is initialized and is being stepped through in the training loop based on the validation loss.

    ```python
    scheduler = ReduceLROnPlateau(optimizer, mode='min', factor=0.1, patience=5, verbose=True)
    ```

4. **Data Loading and Processing**: The `TennyDataset` and `TennyPredictionDataset` classes are set up to handle data loading and processing, including cleaning and scaling the data, which is crucial for effective model training.

5. **Model Training and Evaluation**: Our code properly includes functions for training, testing, and making predictions with the model, considering all aspects of model evaluation and application.

6. **Hyperparameters and Device Configuration**: Hyperparameters like `NUM_EPOCHS`, `BATCH_SIZE`, `HIDDEN_SIZE`, `LEARNING_RATE`, `L1_LAMBDA`, and `L2_LAMBDA` are defined clearly, and the device configuration is set up to utilize GPU resources if available.

Overall, V3 is comprehensive and integrates several advanced techniques in deep learning, which should contribute to the robustness and performance of the Tenny model. As with any machine learning project, you may need to fine-tune these parameters based on the specific characteristics of your dataset and the performance metrics you observe during training and validation.

It's essential to play around with various hyperparameters and structures to discover the ideal mix for your model. This phase is key, requiring patience and a systematic approach. Take your time with it. At this point, Tenny might not produce optimized outcomes yet. However, with adequate experimentation and fine-tuning, it could lay the groundwork for developing a robust instrument for financial time series prediction.
