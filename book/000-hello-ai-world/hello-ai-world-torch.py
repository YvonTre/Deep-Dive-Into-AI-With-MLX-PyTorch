# Please get used to the term 'weights' and 'biases'. They are the parameters of the model. They are the variables that the model learns during training. In the equation '10 * x + 3', 10 is the weight and 3 is the bias.
# You'll see tons of these examples in the AI equations. Also note that in this case, single weight and bias are used. In more complex models, there will be multiple weights and biases.
# The most confusing part is that the weights and biases are also called parameters. So, parameters are the variables that the model learns during training. They are the weights and biases.
# Furthermore, weights and biases are stored in tensors. So, parameters are also tensors. Again, linear algebra comes into play here.
# Weights and biases are mathematically manipulated as matrices and vectors. Why do we need GPUs for AI? Because GPUs are optimized for matrix and vector operations. GPUs are much faster than CPUs for matrix and vector operations. That's why GPUs are used for AI.

# Convert the training data lists to tensors that MLX can work with.
# Note that tensors are basically multi-dimensional arrays. They are the fundamental data structure in MLX.
# Conventionally, PyTorch calls them tensors, while MLX calls them arrays. They are the same thing, but in the AI world, the term tensor is more commonly used.
# You might think multi-dimensional arrays are just matrices. That's true, but tensors can have more than two dimensions, even hundreds or thousands of dimensions.
# You won't be able to visualize tensors with more than three dimensions, but complex AI models can have tensors with hundreds or thousands of dimensions.
# The following code converts the training data lists to tensors and reshapes them to the correct dimensions.
# The -1 in the reshape function means that the number of rows is unknown. The reshape function will automatically calculate the number of rows based on the number of columns.
# For example, if the input is a list of 20 numbers, the reshape function will reshape it to a 20x1 tensor.
# Ah, dimensions, a constant source of confusion for beginners. Don't worry, you'll get used to it.
# Just remember the x_train and y_train lists are 1-dimensional lists. The reshape function converts them to 2-dimensional tensors.
# The first dimension is the number of rows, which is 20 in this case. The second dimension is the number of columns, which is 1 in this case.
# Why the conversion from 1d to 2d? Because PyTorch expects the input to be 2d tensors. It's just a convention. You'll get used to it.

# Learning rate is a hyperparameter that controls how much to change the model in response to the estimated error each time the model weights are updated.
# Parameters are mostly learnable while hyperparameters are mostly tunable.
# - Parameters are the internal variables of the model that are learned from the training data. For example, in a linear regression model, the weights and biases are parameters.
# - Hyperparameters, on the other hand, are the settings of the training process that are set before training starts and are not learned from the data. Examples of hyperparameters include the learning rate, the number of epochs (iterations over the entire dataset), and the batch size.
#
# So, parameters are "learnable" because they are learned from the data during training, while hyperparameters are "tunable" because they are manually set and adjusted by the developer to optimize the learning process and the performance of the model.

# The optimizer updates the model's parameters by using the gradients computed by the loss function.

The equation is y = 10x + 3.
So for x = 100, y should be 10 * 100 + 3, which is 1003.
You might notice that the predicted output is slightly different. Consider why this might be the case.
Hint: The model isn't aware of the exact equation. It works to uncover the underlying relationship between x and y through training on the data. 
It doesn't have prior knowledge of the equation itself. This is why the predicted value might be slightly off and vary each time.

To ensure the effectiveness of the training process and the accuracy of the resulting model, the following factors are essential:

- A sizeable training dataset is required to provide the model with enough information.
- The training dataset must accurately reflect the real-world correlation between x and y to ensure effective learning.
- An appropriate number of training iterations, known as epochs, is necessary for the model to learn from the data adequately.
- The learning rate needs to be chosen carefully; it influences the size of steps the model takes during optimization.
- The structure of the neural network—its architecture—must align with the complexity and type of the data it is learning from.

Selecting the correct hyperparameters, such as the learning rate and the number of epochs, is crucial to a well-trained model. Inappropriate values might result in training issues. 
For instance, encountering 'nan' values during training signals a problem—'nan' stands for 'not a number' and indicates that the model's learning process has gone astray, often due to numerical errors or instability.
