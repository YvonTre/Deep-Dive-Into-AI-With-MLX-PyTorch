# Deep Dive into AI with MLX and PyTorch - The Book

## Part I: Foundations and First Steps - 'The Genesis of AI'

![ai-kitchen.png](images%2Fai-kitchen.png)

In this part, we introduce the readers to the world of AI. We start with the very basics, discussing the fundamentals of artificial intelligence, the architecture of neural networks, and the principles of regression. This section sets the stage for the rest of the book, serving as a comprehensive guide to the building blocks of AI. _**Tenny, the Analyst**_ serves as our guide, helping to illustrate these concepts in a practical, engaging manner.

## Part II: The Art of Classification - 'Navigating the AI Labyrinth'

![tenny-classifier-2.png](010-crafting-your-own-classification-criteria%2Fimages%2Ftenny-classifier-2.png)

Here, we dive into the complexities of AI, exploring the art of creating classification criteria and applying these concepts to real-world data. This section is about expanding our horizon beyond the basics, understanding how AI can be tailored to specific needs and scenarios. We follow the journey of **_Tenny, the Stock Classifier_**, demonstrating how theoretical knowledge is translated into practical applications.

## Part III: The Language of AI - 'Conversing with the Future'

![tenny-the-transformer.png](013-tenny-the-transformer%2Fimages%2Ftenny-the-transformer.png)

Part III is dedicated entirely to Natural Language Processing (NLP) and the transformative technology of transformers. Here, we explore how AI understands, interprets, and generates human language. The highlight is the creation of Tenny, _**the Transformer Sentiment Analyst with an Attitude**_, demonstrating the advanced capabilities of AI in understanding not just language but also the nuances of human emotions and sentiments, well, with an Attitude.

## Part IV: The Eyes of AI - 'Visionary Insights through AI'
![cwk-x.png](017-tenny-the-vision-weaver%2Fimages%2Fcwk-x.png)
Part IV will focus exclusively on computer vision. We'll discuss the basics of how machines perceive and interpret visual data, and then dive deeper into more complex applications like image generation. This section will cover the fundamentals of GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks) and diffusion models, culminating in the creation of _**Tenny, the Vision Weaver**_. This part will showcase AI's ability to not only 'see' but also create visual content, highlighting the cutting-edge advancements in computer vision.
