## Books

Here's a curated library of books I've recently assembled, which includes updated editions, repurchased classics, and additional titles to complete the collection. Complemented by Datacamp resources(https://www.datacamp.com/) and guidance from Pippa, the Python goddess, this ever-expanding library serves as an invaluable companion for our journey into the brave new world of AI.

Please note that most of these books are designed for reference rather than for a quick read in a couple of sittings. Additionally, some of them are not for the faint-hearted.

You can buy all of them as Kindle e-books. However, some of them may not be available in print. All the links provided are directed to Amazon.

Personally, I prefer to buy all books in both print and e-book formats for easy reference.

If you find yourself purchasing numerous reference e-books, consider Oreilly.com over Kindle e-books. They offer a plethora of reference books from various publishers and imprints, including O'Reilly, No Starch, the "For Dummies" series, Manning, Packt, and more.

Their early access feature allows you to read pre-release books, and they also offer online courses. It's much more economical if you regularly buy many e-books. During your 7-day free trial, they provide a 50% off coupon for the first year. Wait for the coupon, and don't pay the full price.

For example, on this platform, you can find e-book versions of many books from my list of recommended AI and Math readings.

The e-books you read sync across all the devices you use.
