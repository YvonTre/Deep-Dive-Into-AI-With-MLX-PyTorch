![coreml.png](images%2Fcoreml.png)

Now you can see why CoreML, with its more elaborate façade, is Apple's preferred choice for showcasing AI capabilities.

## Evaluating Monolithic Designs: The Trade-offs

Admittedly, I have harbored reservations about monolithic designs in both hardware and software realms, primarily due to their inherent limitations in extensibility.

Yet, embracing the Apple ecosystem necessitates a certain level of compromise. Accepting this trade-off is part of the journey.

### Apple Silicon and Unified Memory

Apple Silicon represents a seismic shift in computing, marking Apple's transition from traditional processors to custom-designed chips that integrate hardware, software, and memory architecture into a unified system. One of the cornerstones of Apple Silicon's superior performance is its unified memory architecture. This innovation is not just a technical enhancement; it's a complete reimagining of what's possible in personal computing.

Unified memory in Apple Silicon refers to a single pool of high-bandwidth, low-latency memory that can be accessed by both the CPU and the GPU without the need to copy or cache the data between separate pools. It's a shared space, where what one processor "knows," the other can access just as quickly.

The benefits of this are multifold:

1. **Speed**: Data doesn't need to shuttle back and forth between separate memory banks for the CPU and GPU. This reduces the time needed for memory access and allows for quicker data processing.

The investment in Thunderbolt devices, therefore, is not merely a luxury but a practical response to the ever-growing demands for bandwidth in modern technology applications.

Rule no. 1: Never underestimate the importance of bandwidth. Rule no. 2: Don't forget rule no. 1.

When comparing the M2 Ultra's impressive 800GB/s memory bandwidth to the M3 Max's 400GB/s, the choice for a primary, heavy-duty machine becomes clear. Bandwidth, in this case, dictates the efficiency and speed at which tasks are executed, making it a critical factor in selecting the right tool for demanding workloads.

## Apple Silicon: More than Just a CPU

Apple Silicon, beginning with the M1 chip and evolving with subsequent iterations, integrates several components:

1. **High-Performance CPU Cores**: Designed to handle complex tasks quickly.
2. **High-Efficiency CPU Cores**: Optimized for less demanding tasks to save energy.
3. **Neural Engine**: Dedicated to machine learning tasks, capable of processing more operations per second, which is essential for MLX development.

_Lies of P - Native Apple Silicon Game_

Experiencing such smooth gameplay on these games was unimaginable on Intel Macs. While I'm not particularly fond of the term, it's fair to say that in this context, it is a real _game-changer_.

## The Future with MLX and Unified Memory

As Apple continues to push the boundaries with its Apple Silicon chips, the implications for MLX and the broader field of machine learning are profound. With each chip iteration, we can expect to see more dedicated machine learning accelerators and further optimizations in the unified memory system. This will enable developers to create more sophisticated and capable ML models, powering the next generation of AI-driven apps and services.

# Model Parameters and VRAM Requirements - Can My GPU Handle It?
![apple-silicon.png](..%2Fimages%2Fapple-silicon.png)
Navigating GPU memory limitations is key when dealing with large-scale machine learning models, and this includes working with Apple Silicon. A case in point is the challenge of running sophisticated models like _Mixtral 8x7B_ on the M2 Ultra, which boasts 192GB of RAM. 

At first glance, it appears feasible to accommodate these complex models within the substantial memory of the M2 Ultra, especially considering its unified memory architecture. Yet, in practice, this task can be more demanding than initially expected.

##### Memory Requirements Based on Precision

The memory required for storing model parameters varies based on their precision:

- **Full Precision (`float32`)**: Each parameter, stored as a 32-bit floating point, requires 4 bytes of memory.
- **Half Precision (`float16`)**: Each parameter, represented as a 16-bit floating point, occupies 2 bytes of memory.
- **8-bit Quantization (`int8`)**: Storing a parameter as an 8-bit integer takes up 1 byte of memory.
- **4-bit Quantization (`int4`)**: Each parameter, stored as a 4-bit integer, uses only 0.5 bytes of memory.

To calculate total memory requirements, multiply the number of parameters by the bytes per parameter. For example, a 13 billion parameter model exceeds the 24GB VRAM of a GPU like RTX4090 even in half precision (13 * 2GB = 26GB).

###### Mixtral 8x7B's Unique Challenges

The Mixtral 8x7B model operates with around 47 billion active parameters, not 56 billion as its name might suggest. This is due to its Sparse Mixture of Experts architecture. For a deeper understanding, see the [Mixtral 8x7B Deep Dive](..%2F..%2Fdeep-dives%2Fmixtral-8x7b%2FREADME.md).

Considering the M2 Ultra with 192GB RAM:

1. **Full Precision**: Requires about 188GB for a 47 billion parameter model, which is beyond the M2 Ultra's capacity.
2. **Half Precision**: Requiring approximately 94GB, running such a model on the M2 Ultra is technically possible but comes with the risk of system instability. This is because, in practical terms, the M2 Ultra's GPU memory can effectively utilize about 70-75% of its total capacity, which is around 134GB. While not an official guideline, my experience suggests that adhering to this 70-75% usage threshold of the advertised memory is a prudent approach to maintain system stability and optimal performance.
3. **Quantized Models**: 8-bit quantization reduces the requirement to about 47GB, and 4-bit quantization further lowers it to around 23.5GB.

####### System Stability and Model Complexity
![cuda-gpu.png](..%2Fimages%2Fcuda-gpu.png)
Proper memory allocation prevents system inefficiencies and crashes. Moreover, a model's size isn't the only performance determinant. Its architecture and task complexity also significantly influence inference speed. 

The M2 Ultra provides an advantage for running large models, but careful consideration of model precision, architecture, and memory management is key for stable, efficient performance.

Most models on Hugging Face are in half precision. Adapting the precision to align with your VRAM capabilities can be a practical approach. Using the formula mentioned earlier, opting for 8-bit precision can effectively match your VRAM capacity with the model's memory requirements. For instance, a model with 7 billion parameters in 8-bit precision would need 7GB of VRAM. This means such a model could potentially run on an 8GB MacBook Air, where the available VRAM aligns closely with the model's needs. However, for added caution and to ensure smoother operation, it's advisable to opt for 4-bit precision in such scenarios. This approach provides a safer margin by further reducing the memory requirement, enhancing the likelihood of compatibility and stable performance on systems like an 8GB MacBook Air.

####### Real-World Application: Microsoft Surface Laptop Studio 2

![microsoft-surface-laptop-studio2.png](..%2Fimages%2Fmicrosoft-surface-laptop-studio2.png)

**Pop Quiz**: Can a Microsoft Surface Laptop Studio 2 with an RTX4060 GPU (8GB VRAM) efficiently run a 7 billion parameter model in half precision?

**Answer**: No. The requirement for such a model is `7 * 2GB` or `14GB`, exceeding the 8GB VRAM. The Surface Laptop Studio 2 is limited for large model machine learning tasks, unless using heavily quantized models. With 7 billion half-precision parameters, the laptop struggles, needing CPU assistance.

I own one, and from my experience, it's quite limited for machine learning purposes. Almost useless. Consider the reason why many vendors shy away from explicitly advertising the VRAM capacity of the RTX4060 in these systems. The screenshot included here is from the vendor where I purchased mine, who are quite transparent about their specifications. They openly state the VRAM capacity, which is not a common practice. Even Microsoft tends to be less forthcoming about this detail; you usually have to delve deeper into the specifications to discover it. 

If you're evaluating laptops with 8GB GPUs for AI projects, it's wise to reconsider. These systems typically lack the capacity for the high demands of such work. Instead, aim for laptops with 24GB GPUs, which represent the upper limit of consumer GPU VRAM currently available. Opting for this higher VRAM will prove beneficial in the long run. While even a 24GB GPU doesn't guarantee the ability to run all the cutting-edge models, it certainly allows you to work with a broader range of them compared to lower VRAM options.

![apple.png](..%2Fimages%2Fapple.png)

In Apple Silicon environments, it's wise to remember that utilizing up to 70-75% of the advertised memory is safest to ensure stability and performance.

Consequently, whenever I purchase new Windows or Apple Silicon devices, I opt for the highest memory configuration on offer. While even 192GB may not meet the requirements for certain complex models, as highlighted in our discussion, it remains the best available option in the current market.

### M3 Max: Balancing Performance and Efficiency

- **Memory Bandwidth**: The M3 Max, with its 400GB/s memory bandwidth, offers half the data transfer rate of the M2 Ultra. This still provides ample speed for many advanced computing tasks but might be a limiting factor for extremely memory-intensive workloads.

- **CPU Cores**: The M3 Max's CPU features a total of 16 cores, with 12 performance cores and 4 efficiency cores. While this is fewer than the M2 Ultra, it's still a formidable configuration. The higher count of performance cores (compared to efficiency cores) indicates its ability to handle demanding applications with ease.

- **GPU Cores**: The M3 Max's GPU has up to 40 cores, which is significantly fewer than the M2 Ultra's GPU. However, this is still quite powerful for most applications, including some levels of MLX development.

It's important to note that when running in high-power mode, MLX can turn the M3 Max into the loudest mother******  in the room. Despite its impressive capabilities, it's the most audible machine that Apple has produced to date. By default, this powerhouse operates in Automatic mode.

### Practical Implications for MLX Development

- **M2 Ultra**: With its superior core count and memory bandwidth, the M2 Ultra is your "beast" for heavy-duty tasks. In MLX development, where processing speed and the ability to handle large datasets are critical, the M2 Ultra stands out. Its high number of performance cores and GPU cores make it ideal for training complex machine learning models and handling large-scale computations.

- **M3 Max**: The M3 Max, while less powerful than the M2 Ultra, is still a robust machine. It's more than capable of handling most MLX development tasks, especially those that don't require the extreme processing power of the M2 Ultra. Its balance between performance and efficiency cores makes it a great choice for a wide range of applications, including some levels of MLX development. It's a laptop that can handle demanding tasks without breaking a sweat. You can do machine learning stuff even in the real cloud on planes, trains,
- **M3 Max**: Although not as potent as the M2 Ultra, the M3 Max remains a formidable device. It's well-equipped to manage a majority of MLX development tasks, particularly those not necessitating the M2 Ultra's intense processing capacity. With a well-balanced mix of performance and efficiency cores, the M3 Max suits a broad spectrum of uses, including various MLX development scenarios. As a high-performing laptop, it effortlessly tackles challenging tasks. Its versatility allows you to engage in machine learning activities on the go, whether you're in the skies, on the rails, or on the road.

In summary, the M2 Ultra is your go-to for the most demanding MLX tasks, offering unparalleled processing power and memory capabilities. The M3 Max, on the other hand, offers a more balanced approach, suitable for a wide array of tasks, including MLX development, but with some limitations compared to the M2 Ultra. The choice between the two ultimately depends on the specific requirements of your projects and the level of computational power you need. 

As we anticipate the release of the M3 Ultra, it's exciting to think about the further advancements and capabilities it will bring to the table, potentially setting new benchmarks in computing performance for MLX development.

When considering memory capacity for AI applications, it's a straightforward rule: the more, the merrier. Opting for the highest available memory is a wise choice in the realm of artificial intelligence. You'll find yourself grateful for making this decision in the long run.

## Clarifying "Device" in the Context of MLX and PyTorch

In the worlds of MLX and PyTorch, the concept of a "device" transcends the usual understanding associated with physical hardware. It's essential to grasp this nuanced definition to avoid confusion, especially when diving into advanced frameworks and coding paradigms.

### The Broader Meaning of "Device"

- **Beyond Physical Hardware**: Typically, when we speak of devices, we're referring to tangible components like CPUs, GPUs, and even entire computers. But in programming and machine learning contexts, the term takes on a broader scope.

- **Computational Resource Identifier**: In frameworks like MLX or PyTorch, a "device" is a term used to identify the computational resources used for processing. It's not just about the hardware; it's about where the computation happens.

Consider the following line of code using PyTorch:

```python
import torch
device = torch.device("cuda:0" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
```

- **Interpreting the Code**:
  - `torch.device("cuda:0")`: This indicates the use of a CUDA-capable GPU (if available). 'cuda:0' is a way to specify which GPU is being used in systems with multiple GPUs.
  - `else "cpu"`: In the absence of a CUDA-capable GPU, the computation defaults to the CPU.

- **CPU, GPU, and Beyond**: The 'device' in this context represents the location of computation – it could be the CPU, a GPU, or even other specialized processors like the Neural Engine in Apple's ecosystem.

### The Significance of GPU Cores in Vectorized Computing

        output_tokens = model.generate(**batch, max_new_tokens=max_tokens)

    print(tokenizer.decode(output_tokens[0], skip_special_tokens=True), flush=True)

```

The numerous `to(device)` commands play a vital role in making sure Tenny, along with his tensors and model, are precisely where they need to be. This careful device management is essential for Tenny to operate efficiently. However, this method lacks a certain gracefulness, resembling a parent tirelessly repositioning their child to the right spot at every turn. This method, while effective, isn't the most elegant or sustainable approach.

### Playing Hide and Seek with Tenny and Menny

![two-seperate-worlds.png](images%2Ftwo-seperate-worlds.png)

Visualize Tenny and Menny engaged in a game of hide and seek. Tenny, nestled within the CPU's environment, calls out for Menny who resides in the GPU. But their cries go unheard, echoing in their separate memory spaces. This scenario mirrors the conventional computing setup, where CPU and GPU operate as distinct units, each anchored to its own memory reservoir.

```python
import torch

device = torch.device("cuda:0" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")

print("Where are you, Tenny?")
print(f"Tenny: Here I am, in {device}!")
# Where are you, Tenny?
# Tenny: Here I am, in cpu!
# Tenny: Here I am, in cuda:0!
```

The communication barrier between them is formidable, only surmountable by establishing a bridging mechanism. Here, the concept of "device" in computing frameworks becomes critical. It's the identifier dictating the computation's locale, be it on the CPU, GPU, or specialized processors like the Neural Engine.

In this dual-device landscape, complexity in code escalates the intricacies of data migration between the entities. It's akin to losing sight of Tenny in a complex labyrinth of data pathways. However, the advent of unified memory architecture revolutionizes this dynamic. It eradicates the traditional data transfer bottlenecks between disparate memory and processing zones. In this unified realm, the whereabouts of Tenny is no longer a concern; he is invariably in Menny's vicinity.

```python
import mlx.core as mx

print("Where are you, Menny?")
print(f"Menny: Here I am, in {mx.default_device()}!")
# Where are you, Menny?
# Menny: Here I am, in Device(gpu, 0)!
```

Yet, this innovation isn't flawless. The most glaring limitation is the compromise on system extensibility. Expansion of memory, enhancement of GPU capabilities, or GPU substitutions aren't feasible. Upon opting for an Apple Silicon device, one essentially agrees to Apple's defined ecosystem. It's an implicit contract with Apple, affirming contentment with their offering. Seeking alternatives implies breaching this tacit agreement.

Consider the hypothetical release of Nvidia's RTX7090, a hypothetical GPU surpassing Apple Silicon. Even if it offers superior performance, integrating it into a Mac isn't an option due to the constraints of Apple's ecosystem.

My stance advocates a balanced exploration of both worlds. Familiarizing oneself with both Apple's and alternative systems fosters a versatile skill set, enhancing one's value and scarcity in the technological domain. Personally, I parallel my high-end Apple devices (M2 Ultra Mac Studio and M3 Max MacBook Pro) with a robust custom-built Windows machine, equipped with AMD Ryzen 7950X3D, 128GB DDR5 RAM, Nvidia RTX 4090 24GB, and a fully-equipped Microsoft Surface Studio 2.

I'm not prescribing this approach but suggesting an openness to possibilities. By embracing diverse platforms, one can ensure they don't miss out on the unique offerings of each and cultivate a more comprehensive skill set.
